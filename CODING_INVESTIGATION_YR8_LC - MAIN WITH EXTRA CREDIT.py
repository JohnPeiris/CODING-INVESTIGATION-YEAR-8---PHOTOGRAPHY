# In this code I will be determining the settings required for a camera based on inputted settings from the user in   #
# in order to allow for an effective and high quality photo to be accomplished. This code can determine aperture,     #
# shutterspeed and ISO based off the inputs of the previous three, while maintining a steady baseline. If the lighting#
# condition is brighter, the baseline brightness decreases and vice versa. If a user enters values of which a         #
# brightness baseline cannot be achieved, the program will prompt the user to increase or decrease certain settings to#
# accommodate a brightness baseline which is sought. In addition, this code is formidable against erroneous user      #
# inputs and will not crash at the plight of receiving a false or ill-typed entry. Based on the user's input, the code#
# can recommend 1, 2 or 3 settings, depending on the user's preference. I have also used some object oriented         #
# programming in this code. Selecting the lighting condition is easier as the code allows the user to enter their city#
# or suburb to generate an automatic weather report and status in their area.                                         #
