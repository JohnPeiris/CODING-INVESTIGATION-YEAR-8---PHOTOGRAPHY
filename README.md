# CODING-INVESTIGATION-YEAR-8---PHOTOGRAPHY
THIS IS A MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS CODE FOR THE MATHS INVESTIGATION.
I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY REPOCUSSIONS OF COPYING THIS CODE.
ERROR HANDLING SHOULD BE DELETED BEFORE USE.
ANY IMPORT OR MODULE ERRORS CAN BE HANDLED BY RESEARCH AND SIMPLE COMMANDS ON TERMINAL.
THIS IS PURELY A GUIDE TOO.
ALSO, IF YOU ARE USING WINDOWS, DELTE THE IMPORT OS IN THE CODE.
APART FROM THAT, ENJOY!!
