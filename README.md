# CODING-INVESTIGATION-YEAR-8---PHOTOGRAPHY
THIS IS A MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS CODE FOR THE MATHS INVESTIGATION.
I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY REPOCUSSIONS OF COPYING THIS CODE.
ERROR HANDLING SHOULD BE DELETED BEFORE USE.
ANY IMPORT OR MODULE ERRORS CAN BE HANDLED BY RESEARCH AND SIMPLE COMMANDS ON TERMINAL.
THIS IS PURELY A GUIDE TOO.
SOME SEEMED TO HAVE ERRORS RUNNING THIS CODE IN GROK AS SOME MODULES DO NOT EXIST. IF SO, I HAVE UPLOADED A GROK-FRIENDLY VERSION OF THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS, BUT THIS IS MISSING 1 OR 2 SMALL FEATURES THAT COULD BE PRESENT IF USING VS CODE.
ALSO, IF YOU ARE USING WINDOWS, DELTE THE IMPORT OS IN THE CODE.
APART FROM THAT, ENJOY!!
